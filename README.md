## Kotlin with React Native

This project is a multiplatform project designed to get you started with Kotlin, React Native, and whichever Kotlin JVM backend you may decide on.

The `quester-react-native` folder can also be split out and used on its own if you only want to use Kotlin and React Native.

Rename the project and all the packages to whatever you would like, I'm using this for a side project so I named the packages to that.

The readme in the `quester-react-native` folder gives detailed instructions on its use. So navigate there to get started.
